# COVID-Analytics
- The objective of this project was to gain actionable insights on Covid death cases and affected people across the continent. In addition, to give some idea about how vaccination could help reduce the number of death cases in USA
- The project was developed and executed using Tableau to analyze the covid death cases
- One of goals was to identify why Covid deaths were higher in Europe than USA while USA had most confirmed COVID cases
- For this project, data had been extracted and combined from various sources. After data cleansing, data transformations, a data connection was created in Tableau
- Tableau dashboards were intuitive and interactive with visualization of top 10 covid affected and covid death countries. Dashboard also showed the covid deaths across the continent. A comparison of the average vaccinated people between USA and Europe was shown. Dashboard revealed vaccination actually reduced the death cases in USA over the time. Then a forecasting was performed to display the covid cases and new death by October 2022. Bar charts, symbols maps, line chat, and filters were used to facilitate data exploration and decision-making
- As a result of the project, we can get an overall idea that by October 2022, the world may have 12,532,884,172+ COVID confirmed cases thus the world needs to act fast seeing the factors such as vaccines
